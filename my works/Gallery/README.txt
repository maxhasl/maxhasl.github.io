Functional:
1) if nothing is entered in the input and the "Search" button is pressed - an error message appears to the right (with a thread)
2) if the input is not empty and the "Search" is pressed, the specified tag is formatted with an ai and the ajax request is sent
3) 20 pictures are displayed on the tag, after 2 seconds (sometimes pictures have to be loaded for a long time) are rebuilt using masonry
4) when you hover over a picture - it increases by 2 times
5) when you click on a picture - it is added to your gallery (the gallery is also beautifully rebuilt with masonry)
6) when you try to add the same picture to the gallery - the right side of the search button displays an error
7) when you click on the picture in the gallery, it opens in the carousel below
8) when clicking on the red X in the picture, it is removed from the gallery
9) when clicking on the gallery's arrows, pictures are displayed in the order of their order in the gallery
10) when deleting a picture from the gallery, the queue in the carousel shifts and it also works
11) when you re-request (search for pictures with another tag), the gallery is saved, all functionality is saved
